# Sky Climber

Sky Climber is a mobile platformer that was designed and developed by Cutlass Studios on July 20, 2017. Players can climb and view their score while playing the game and view their highscore. Players can collect coins to purchase in-game reskins of platforms. Users can also redeem coins to revive their player at the point in which they fell.
